Effective date: November 16, 2019

Day One Labs LLC ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Pennywise mobile application (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, the terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.

# Information Collection and Use

We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.

## Types of Data Collected

- **Personal data:** We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a Pennywise account to provide an email address.
- **Financial information:** When you connect one or multiple bank accounts to our Services, we store a so called 'access token' that allows us to pull financial transactions from your bank account on your behalf. We load financial transaction information from your connected bank accounts. This information includes, but is not limitied to: the title of the transaction, the date the transaction was executed, the account to which the transaction belongs and the category to which you assign the transaction. The financial transaction information is stored exclusively on your device, not in our online database.
- **Communications with Us:** You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with us regarding a support question, or sign up for a newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).
- **Log Information:** Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including, but not limited to, the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services.
- **Usage Information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services. This includes, but is not limited to, the actions that you perform in the app–in other words, who did what, when and to what thing in the app (e.g., visited the 'Todo' tab, categorized a transaction, changed the notification settings). We also collect information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.
- **Location Information:** We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.

## How and Why We Use Information

Day One Labs LLC uses the collected data for various purposes:

- To provide and maintain our Services–for example, to set up and maintain your account or load your financial transactions;
- To further develop and improve our Services–for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to manage their finances more effectively;
- To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;
- To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of Day One Labs LLC and others, which may result in us declining a transaction or the use of our Services;
- To communicate with you. For example, we may email you to solicit your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Pennywise. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (Please keep in mind that even if you opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account); and
- To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content recommendations, target our marketing messages to groups of our users (for example, those who have been our user for a certain length of time), and serve relevant advertisements.

# Sharing Information

## How We Share Information

We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share data to fulfill the purposes for which you provide it; to enforce or apply our Terms of Service. We may disclose or transfer personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this privacy policy:

- **Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:** We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.
- **Third Party Vendors:** We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you, those that assist us with our marketing efforts, those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers) and vendors that help us aggregate your banking and other financial accounts.
- **Legal and Regulatory Requirements:** We may disclose information about you to comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request, to protect and defend the rights or property of Day One Labs LLC, to prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service, to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public, to protect against legal liability.
- **To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:** We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Day One Labs LLC, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
- **Business Transfers:** In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Day One Labs LLC goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
- **With Your Consent:** We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to.
- **Aggregated or De-Identified Information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services and we may share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.
- **Published Support Requests:** And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
